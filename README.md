# Level Editor Jump 'n Run

First steps:

- [ ] Create file CHANGELOG.md according to https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
- [ ] Create directory `docs/` to later store documentation of the project
- [ ] Set up gradle project with `gradle init` - check that correct gradle wrapper version is used
- [ ] Add modules as needed (e.g., `client` and `server`)
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` file
- [ ] Create `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to run `./gradlew assemble` and `./gradlew check` or similar,
  to automatically check for code-quality issues.
